###To Do (possibilities for improvement):
- Move legend to bottom position to free up space for graph
- Force Y-axis to start at 0%
- Create "check/uncheck all" buttons
- Generate more helpful error messages when no data matches request
- Gray out options that contain no data
- Resolve redundancy:
 * Products/Services/R&D breakout in Category menu vs.
 * Other Products/Other Services/Other R&D breakout in Portfolio menu
- Add help text explaining data categories on mouseover
- Show total obligations amounts of the selected categories 
 * add second axis with Amount instead of Percent
 * add simple text box with total obligation amount for the selections
- Change background / color / grid lines to more closely replicate visual format from Defense Acquisition Trends report
- Allow comparison by enabling a 2nd subset of data to be added to the chart, on user request
- Experiment with different visual formats
  * stacked bar
  * area chart
  * others?
